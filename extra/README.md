## About my project

I am trying to re-use the **Voigtlander lens** of an old **Voigtlander Vito CL** camera, in a **Sony A7 II**.

To do this:
- Remove and clean the lens
- A L39-NEX adaptor => [Amazon - Spain](https://www.amazon.es/gp/product/B084MDB1YS/)
- The 3D pieces that [taomaker](https://github.com/taomaker) shared

Additional tools:
- A spanner wrench (I am using here the recommended by *taomaker*) => [Amazon Spain](https://www.amazon.es/gp/product/B00NURCWTC/)
